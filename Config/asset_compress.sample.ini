;
; * cacheConfig - set to true to cache the parsed configuration data
;   so it doesn't get parsed on each request.
;
; * alwaysEnableController - Set to true to always enable the
;   AssetsController.  Generally you will want to disable the controller
;   in production, as it could allow an attacker to request expensive
;   resources repeatedly.  However, if you need the controller available
;   in production.  You can enable this flag.
